Ray Tracer Program in Shadertoy GLSL.

This is a ray tracer program for drawing on a canvas, built with fragment shaders.

There are 103 spheres, and they have different materials. This program also samples 10 times, and uses Shclick's approximation. The program performs anti-aliasing and creates fuzz and blur like effects. Most code is referenced to Ray Tracing in One Weekend.
