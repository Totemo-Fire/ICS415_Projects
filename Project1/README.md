Ray Tracer Program

This is a ray tracer program for drawing on a canvas.



For the final task: there are many spheres, and they have different materials. The program performs anti-aliasing and creates fuzz and blur like effects. Most code is referenced to Ray Tracing in One Weekend.
For all other tasks, there are 4 spheres, with one being a large yellow ground sphere. The code is referenced to Graphics from Scratch: A Programmer's Introduction to 3D Rendering.

Compiling and running:
	The compiler used to test and run the program is Clang with C++11.
	Simply compile main.cc (no external libraries required), then run the executable. The program will generate a bitmap image file of the scene. The file is named image.bmp. It may take some time to render the image.
